Welcome to Xixian Liao's homepage.

I'm a PhD student at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) under the joint supervision of [Gemma Boleda](https://gboleda.github.io) and [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol/). My research currently focuses on understanding the use of referring expressions, by using quantitative and computational methods.
