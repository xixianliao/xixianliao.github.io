Welcome to Xixian Liao's homepage.

I'm a first-year PhD student at Pompeu Fabra University under joint supervision of [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol/) and [Gemma Boleda](https://gboleda.github.io). My current research interests are mainly anaphoric expressions. Different from traditional methodology in psycholinguistic studies which often design empirical experiments, I'm trying to make use of large-scale corpora and datasets created for machine learning. These corpora and datasets texts are more naturally produced and annotated with abundant linguistic information.


The webpage is still under construction ;)
