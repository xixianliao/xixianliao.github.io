Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Engineer at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. I obtained my PhD in Computational Linguistics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) under the joint supervision of [Gemma Boleda](https://gboleda.github.io) and [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol/).
