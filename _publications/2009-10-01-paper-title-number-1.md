Referring expressions play an important role in object identification. This study analyzes the use of redundant color adjectives (RCAs) in reference to different object categories in largescale datasets of real-world images in order to investigate how this phenomenon displays in real-world scenes and whether it is in line with the results reported in previous artificially designed experiments. It quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes two types of data: naturalistic object descriptions and genuine referring expressions. The results on one hand confirm that the use of RCAs varies across object categories in real-world scenes; on the other hand, they also suggest that the use of color adjectives varies depending on the task settings (descriptive task compared to referential task in this study); and people may produce more RCAs for some specific subcategories of objects.
